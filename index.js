/* You can get the Nth character (letter) from a string by writting the string variable name plus [N] e.g:

const abc = 'abc';
abc[1]

The return value will be a string containing only 1 character (in the above case that character was 'b') the first 
character has position 0, which causes the last character to be found at position string.length - 1. In other words
a two character string has length two and its characters have positions 1 and 0. write a function that takes a string
as an argument and returns a number that indicate how many uppercase 'B's that string contains once that is completed
write another function which extends the first function by taking in a second arguement which is the character you wish
to count the number of.  */
